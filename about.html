        <p>For the last six years I have been running my own cryptocurrency mining business, however with the changes in
          Ethereum mining I decided to close down my operation in late 2021. Because, I had already been writing a small
          amount of code for my business it was a natural progression for me to explore coding as a career possibility.
          I have a deep interest in machine learning and data storage so I gravitated towards Python as a focus. I think
          a perfect environment for me as a new coder is an environment where I can be exposed to new challenges and
          grow my coding abilities while using my existing coding skills to further the companies mission and growth. My
          background in customer service makes me an ideal person for collaborative work in any team scenario.</p>

        <p>Hello, my name is Aubrey Corsetti and I am a Software Developer. Before changing my career towards tech, I
          was a dog groomer and a solar panel salesperson. Two very different things.. fortunately from that I've
          learned many skills that may not be tech but I can bring into my tech career such as; time management, the
          ability to multitask and swift problem solving skills. I decided to go into software development because I've
          always been intrigued with how websites/apps are built and presented to the user as well as coming up with
          ways on how I would improve them. I would love to use my skill in a fun environment that is open-minded,
          allows me to be creative and aims to leave a positive, memorable experience for the users that visit our site.
          I am sure that no matter where I go in life, tech will always be my passion and I am always excited to create
          something that will be used by many.</p>

        <p>Before I decided to change careers, I was a trainer at a grocery warehouse, as well serving in the US Navy
          reserves. I decided to learn software development, because I am fairly tech savvy, and I wanted to have a
          career that has high growth potential. I picked this specific skill, because I wanted to challenge myself.
          Also, for my personal business, I wanted to learn more about coding. The ideal environment that I would use
          this skill is at a tech company, be it large or small, that's striving to make some positive steps for
          humanity. My previous leadership experience gives me a boost in the tech field, because there is more than one
          way to skin a cat. Some people score, some people rebound and assist. Some people see all of this, and
          facilitate. </p>

        <p>Hello every one. I left the Navy not to long ago and figured I should learn something new while I take a
          brief break from work. I chose software development path because programming language can solve problems
          without creating tangible products, but still get adopted by the masses. I would like to utilize this new
          skill to automate analytical processes by incorporating machine learning ability of programming languages,
          whether it be scientific research or business analysis. </p>
