The active can take advantage of all of the usual off-piste options like snowshoeing, and adrenaline seekers will not want to miss the heart-pounding ride on the Olympic bob run that reaches speeds of 80 miles per hour. Other activities include taking a stroll through the highest shopping street in Europe, “Via Serlas,” which hosts all of the top brands and boutiques, enjoying spectator sports like cricket on ice and the Cartier Polo World Cup. If you would like to ride the rails, you may want to take the railway to the top of Muottas Muragi and watch the sunset or join an evening excursion to the Alp Grum, where fondue is served. This destination is also considered a “foodie heaven,” with five Michelin star restaurants, and it also receives an incredible 300+ days of sunshine each year.</p> */

//<p>Dubai straddles a natural inlet called Dubai Creek on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf. Dubai is known as a city of skyscrapers, ports, and beaches, where big business takes place alongside sun-seeking tourism. Dubai’s rulers have sought to increase the city’s limited seafronts, and, in the absence of natural offshore islands, developers are encouraged to construct giant man-made islands off the coast of the city. The most famous of these islands is Palm Jumeirah, which has the shape of a palm tree.</p>
